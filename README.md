Hello everyone, I'm Sumit Samantray, and data is my jam! I'm recently a postgraduate from DIT University Dehradun, but numbers and insights have always been my passion. Before diving into the academic world, I spent over 5 years in the fast-paced world of sales and marketing, working with amazing companies like Google and Samsung.
While I enjoyed the thrill of closing deals, my analytical side craved more. That's why I decided to pursue my MCA and unlock the power of data analysis. But I'm not just about crunching numbers – I see them as stories waiting to be told. And what better way to tell a story than through the lens of a camera?
When I'm not glued to my laptop, you'll find me exploring new places, capturing their essence through photography. Travel is my fuel, and every trip adds a new chapter to my data-driven perspective. So, I guess you could say I'm a data analyst with a traveller's soul or a travel photographer with a knack for numbers.

In short, I'm a curious learner, a passionate analyst, and a storyteller at heart. And I'm excited to bring my unique blend of skills and experiences to the  team.
