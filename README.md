Hi everybody, I'm Sumit Samantray, and information is my favourite! I'm, as of late, a postgraduate from DIT University Dehradun, however, numbers and bits of knowledge have forever been my obsession. Before entering the academic world, I spent over five years in the fast-paced sales and marketing industry, working for amazing companies like Google and Samsung. My analytical side wanted more, but the thrill of closing deals was enjoyable. That is the reason I chose to seek after my Lord in PC Applications (MCA) through information science and open the force of information examination. However, I view numbers as stories waiting to be told, not just numbers. Furthermore, is everything a better method for telling a story than from the perspective of a camera? When I'm not glued to my computer, I can explore new places and photograph their essence. Travel is my fuel, and each outing adds another section to my information-driven viewpoint. Thus, I suppose you could say I'm an information expert with an explorer's spirit or a movement photographic artist with a skill for numbers. So, I'm an interested student, an energetic investigator, and a narrator on a fundamental level. Furthermore, I'm eager to bring my interesting mix of abilities and encounters to the group.

In short, I'm a curious learner, a passionate analyst, and a storyteller at heart. And I'm excited to bring my unique blend of skills and experiences to the  team.
