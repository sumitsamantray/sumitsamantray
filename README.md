Hi everybody, I'm Sumit Samantray, and information is my favourite! I'm, as of late, a postgraduate from DIT College Dehradun, however, numbers and bits of knowledge have forever been my obsession. I spent over five years in the fast-paced sales and marketing industry, working for amazing companies like Google and Samsung, before entering the academic world. My analytical side wanted more, but the thrill of closing deals was enjoyable. That is the reason I chose to seek after my Lord in PC Applications (MCA) through information science and open the force of information examination. However, I view numbers as stories waiting to be told, not just numbers. Furthermore, is everything a better method for telling a story than from the perspective of a camera? When I'm not glued to my computer, you can find me exploring new places and photographing their essence. Travel is my fuel, and each outing adds another section to my information-driven viewpoint. Thus, I suppose you could say I'm an information expert with an explorer's spirit or a movement photographic artist with a skill for numbers. So, I'm an inquisitive student, an energetic investigator, and a narrator on a fundamental level. Furthermore, I'm eager to bring my interesting mix of abilities and encounters to the group.

In short, I'm a curious learner, a passionate analyst, and a storyteller at heart. And I'm excited to bring my unique blend of skills and experiences to the  team.
